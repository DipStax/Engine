# Engine (futur mono repoy): 

> I take a break from working on this repository to focus on my end of strudy, so no update until ~ March 2024.

## Description:

**This is my sandbox repository to build and create what I wan't.**

For now this contain only:
- an `ECS`,
- the begining of a `Muti Media Library` (**LLM**),
- the real begining of an `XML framework` to create dynamic interface.

For now every piece of code are written in "modern" C++20. In a certain amount of time I will move to a mono-repository style to add all my other project (not necessarily in using C++ or even C).
